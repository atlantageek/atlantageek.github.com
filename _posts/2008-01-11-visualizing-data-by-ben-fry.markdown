I just got this book a few days ago and I'm not really that impressed.  It seems it is focusing on a Java tool called 'Processing' that. He spends more time on how to write code for this tool than on designing data visualization interfaces.

This is unfortunate, I was hoping for a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JNoBAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:Edward+inauthor:R+inauthor:Tufte&amp;ei=RwGHR_67Go307QL0vJyVBg">Tufte </a>type book updated to the interactive environment we have today. That would be something useful. Instead I get a tool manual.  I still have 2/3 of the book left.  Hopefully it improves.
