A really cool looking design.&nbsp; Apparently the goal was to create stuff that traditional craftsmen using sustainable materials to create high value products.&nbsp; Singgih Kartono came up with the <a href="http://areaware.com/?p=21253&amp;lng=en&amp;id=221">Areaware Mango Wooden Radio</a> . I like the idea but I thing a clock design would have carried over better.&nbsp; I have trouble dedicating that much space to an object I rarely need to look at from afar.&nbsp; By the way why someone needs to mix a cool wall clock with an mp3 player.&nbsp; Now that would rock.
