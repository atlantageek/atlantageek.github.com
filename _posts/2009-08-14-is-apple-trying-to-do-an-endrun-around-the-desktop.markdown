A friend told me suggested apple was making a cradle that allowed you to connect your iphone to a monitor , keyboard and mouse.  This is an interesting idea.  Could apple try to make a dent into the desktop market by replacing the desktop. After all windows XP's minimum requirements includes a 233 MHz processor.  The iphone runs 600 MHz and Im sure the iphone's OS is not nearly as bloted as XP.  What is the real difference between an iphone and a Mac.
