Just came back from a competitive bidding event. My company was one of the 5 suppliers that were bidding on replacing the customers test equipment with our equipment. We interviewed everyone from the guys in the back office to the guys in the field and the interviewees scored us on the types of questions we asked.

One item that came up was knowledge management. The customer is generating a huge amout of data, but there is no way for them to compare test results from one customer to the other. Or to compare data from different vendors.

There seems to be a great opportunity here for someone to leverage these issues.
