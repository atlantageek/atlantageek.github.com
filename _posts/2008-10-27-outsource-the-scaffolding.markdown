[Outsourcing the scaffolding](http://blog.kischuk.com/2008/08/11/outsource-the-scaffolding/trackback/) is an article from a fellow Atlantian discussing how best to oursource code. His thesis is that you should only outsource the the initial version or core product.  Once you get into the details where the problem is nolonger simple you need to bring it in house.

I agree and I think this applies to outsourced development even when it is a division of the same company.  When the designers and requirement gathers are far away from the developers you are asking for trouble.
