I've been developing software professionally for the past 25 years. I enjoy working with data whether its making fast queries, creating data visualizations or data analytics.  I enjoy finding novel approaches to difficult problems.

### My favorite techs are
Angular 2+
node.js
Python when working with open-cv
redis
postgresql/postgis

But I've worked with a lot more than that.
