Postgresql 9.1 Now ships with a module called ltree. This is a cool postgresql that allows you to model hierarchies in you database and leverages the GIST indexing mechanism built into postgres.
Assume you are modeling several organizations:


	CREATE TABLE orgs (path ltree);
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division1');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division1.storeZ');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division1.storeY');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division2');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division2.storeV');
	INSERT INTO orgs VALUES ('Top.OrgA.Division2.storeW')
	CREATE INDEX path_gist_idx ON test USING gist(path);
	CREATE INDEX path_idx ON test USING btree(path);
Now you can do some interesting queries such as Give me all the rstores in Division1
	select * from orgs where path ~ "Top.OrgA.Division1.*"
or give me all the stores (where the path is at least 4 items long)
	select * from orgs where path ~ Top.{4}

This is another neat feature that Postgresql gives you but mysql doesn't
