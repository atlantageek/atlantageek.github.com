I often develop my flex code on a machine that is not running a web server. So I have to hardcode the IP of a working server when I need to pull data from the hosting server.

This can be a pain because before you checkin the code you have to remember to change the method of pulling the IP address.

So here is my solution
	var domain:String=mx.utils.URLUtil.getServerName(url);
	var port_nbr:int=mx.utils.URLUtil.getPort(url);
	if (flash.system.Security.sandboxType == "localTrusted")
	{
		Alert.show("In Development mode:"+domain+","+port);
		webService.wsdl="http://10.0.0.60:3000/services/wsdl";
	}
	else
	{
		webService.wsdl="http://"+domain+":"+port+"/services/wsdl";
	}
Obviously this is for web services but this technique can be used for sockets as well.
