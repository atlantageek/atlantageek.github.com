#DVRs for over the air TV

One of the advantages of cable service is something that is totally unrelated to their content.  The settop box is a great convience. The emergence of MSO provided DVRs has added a lot of value to their service. So if you really do want to cut the cord its time to consider how are you going to replace that $10/month leased settop box.

There are a couple of options. The grand-daddy of them  all is Tivo (Yes theyâ€™re still in business.) Tivo and ReplayTV(and they are not) invented the DVR business.  However Tivo is notorious for being expensive. Not just for the initial price ($149-349) but also the monthly charge $15/month.  You can also get a lifetime account for $500. (Thats a 3 year payback).  
Used Tivos with lifetime memberships can be a good deal off of ebay. You can pickup a series 2 Tivo (OK 8 years old) with a lifetime account for $100. But it should work well. The newer Tivos do more than TV though.  They do netflix, amazon and other stuff thats kind of cool if you dont have a smart tv or smart dvd player. But The monthly fee is what you were trying to get away from when you cut the cable cord.  Tivo really needs to rethink their target market.
